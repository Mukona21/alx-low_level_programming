# C - More functions, more nested loops

## Learning Objectives

- At the end of this project, I am expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

* What are nested loops and how to use them
* What is a function and how do you use functions
* What is the difference between a declaration and a definition of a function
* What is a prototype
* Scope of variables
* What are the gcc flags -Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra -std=gnu89
* What are header files and how to to use them with #include

## Technologies used

* Files compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
*  Code used the Betty style and checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
