# 0x05. C - Pointers, arrays and strings

## Learning Objectives

- At the end of this project, I was expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

* What are pointers and how to use them
* What are arrays and how to use them
* What are the differences between pointers and arrays
* How to use strings and how to manipulate them
* Scope of variables

# Technologies used

* All files were compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
* code used the Betty style and checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
